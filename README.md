# Java Encoders

The objective of this document is to summarize how the most common Java encoders behave with different _one character_
input.
Each library tested is handled as a pluggable endpoint that will receive the list of characters to evaluate and returns
the converted list of characters. These details are then included in the final result in form of printable HTML table.
 
## Methodology
The set of input that were considered relevant to be encoded are:

```
                0x000A, // LF - Line feed
                0x000B, // VT - Vertical Tab
                0x000C, // FF - Form feed
                0x000D, // CR -  Carriage Return
                0x0085, // NEL - Next line
                0x008B, // Partial line forward
                0x008D, // Reverse line feed
                0x2028, // LS - Line separator
                0x2029, // PS - Paragraph separator
                '"',
                '\'',
                '<',
                '>',
                ':',
                ';',
                '\\',
                '&',
                '/',
                '=',
                '(',
                ')',
                '[',
                '{',
                '}',
                '#',
                '`',
```

where the first subset between _0x000A_ to _0x2029_ are specifically considered relevant for CRLF injection and as such
connected to CWE 93, 113 and 117. These set of characters was created after taking into consideration also the following
references: 
[Visual Studio Docs - Encodings and line endings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/encodings-and-line-breaks?view=vs-2019) 
[CODING HORROR - The Great Newline Schism](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-great-newline-schism/)

The characters
                0x0085, // NEL - Next line
                0x008B, // Partial line forward
                0x008D, // Reverse line feed
where included to have an extended view on the behaviour of the reviewed methods on uncommon characters that in some
context can be considered as introducing a new line. 0x0085(NEL - Next line) is considered as new line in Visual Studio,
while 0x008B (Partial line forward) and 0x008D (Reverse line feed) are usually seen in old printers manuals and often
considered as simple white space.

The remaining list of characters were considered relevant for the risk of Cross Site scripting (CWE 80).

# Rendered Encoding. generated folder
The folder _generated_ contains a list of output generated by each method in HTML format

*Note:* 
- ~unchgd identifies values that were not changed by the tested method
- EMPTY identifies when the tested method returned an empty string when handling the input character

# Libraries
## org.springframework.web.util.UriUtils

Spring-web defines a list of methods in the abstract class `org.springframework.web.util.UriUtils` that can be used to
perform URI encoding and decoding based on [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

These methods implement an allow list approach to identify a character that is part of the allowed set for the specified
encoding. All the characters that are outside the allowed set are represented using Percent-Encoding, % followed by the
two hexadecimal digits representing that octet's numeric value (for example: %20 for the space character in the US-ASCII
encoding).

## org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils

The methods `normalizeSpace` and `deleteWhitespace` from the library `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` can be
considered valid cleansers for CRLF injection. They both modify the returned string in different ways.
`normalizeSpace` returns the argument string with whitespace normalized by using *trim* to remove leading and trailing
whitespace and then replacing sequences of whitespace characters by a single space.
`deleteWhitespace` removes all whitespaces from the original input string.
For these reasons even though they can be used as cleanser for CWEID 117 (Log Injection) I would personally prefer
methods that were explicitly designed for the purpose of remediate Log Injection while at the same time maintaining the
content original string.

## org.owasp.esapi.StringUtilities

It is interesting to note how `replaceLinearWhiteSpace` doesn't handle [0x2028] - LINE SEPARATOR and [0x2029] -
PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR that are often considered relevant for the risk of CRLF injection. In case when the scope where the
tainted string will be logged is unknown I would choose a different method than `replaceLinearWhiteSpace`.
